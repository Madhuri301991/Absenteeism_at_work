# Absenteeism_at_work
The project will address Absenteeism at a company during work time. It will work on predicting Absenteeism from work, whether or not an employee will be absent for a specific number of hours on a work day. It will explore whether a person presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work at some point in time or not.
